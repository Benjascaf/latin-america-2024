## Our goals for the gem5 bootcamp

- Make gem5 less painful and flatten the learning curve
- Give you a vocabulary for asking questions‚Äã
- Provide a reference for the future‚Äã
- Give you material to take back and teach your colleagues

### Other likely outcomes

- You will be overwhelmed by the amount of information and how large gem5 is
  - That's OK! You can take these materials with you and refer back to them
- You will not understand everything
  - That's OK! You can ask questions as we go

---

## How this is going to work

- We'll be going mostly top-down
  1. How to use gem5
  2. How to each model can be used
  3. How to develop your own models and modify existing models
- Highly iterative:
  - You'll see the same thing over and over
  - Each time it will be one level deeper
- Lots of coding examples
  - Both live coding and practice problems

---

## Coding examples

You can write the following code

```python
print("Hello, world!")
print("You'll be seeing a lot of Python code")
print("The slides will be a reference, but we'll be doing a lot of live coding!")
```

And you'll see this output.

```console
Hello, world!
You'll be seeing a lot of Python code
The slides will be a reference, but we'll be doing a lot of live coding!
```
