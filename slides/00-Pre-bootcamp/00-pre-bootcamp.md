Some things to get you started before the bootcamp

## Pre-bootcamp Reading

### If you want to get familiar with gem5

These papers are good to skim. You do not need to read carefully.

- The original gem5 paper: [The gem5 simulator](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2024716.2024718)
- The gem5-20 paper: [The gem5Simulator: Version 20.0+](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03152)

The "original" paper was published in 2011 just after m5 and GEMS combined to form gem5 and is a good overview of the simulator architecture and models included at that time.

The new gem5-20 paper discusses the changes since the 2011 paper and provides an overview of the current models in gem5.
